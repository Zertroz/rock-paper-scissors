# Rock Paper Scissors 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The website allows users to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against a computer opponent that can randomly select a potential option. There are two game modes, one with traditional rock, paper, and scissors rules, and an additional game mode with five options and extra rules to accomodate them. The website keeps track of how many wins each side has.


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

To install, simply clone the [github repository](https://github.com/Zertroz/rock-paper-scissors/tree/main) down to the local machine, then open index.html.


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This is our final project of Mod 1, and we had a week to complete it. The functionality was completed after the second day, in about 5-6 hours. After that was making it reflect on the DOM and making the DOM itself look presentable. CSS took the longest time, but the project was largely complete by Friday.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

Just [me](https://github.com/Zertroz).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

Our goal was to apply our knowledge of JavaScript and event listeners, as well as work with a data model before adjusting the DOM. In addition, we were expected to problem solve on our own, without outside help.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins:
1. Getting the functionality done in an efficient manner.
1. Getting that functionality to effect the DOM in a satisfying way.

Challenges: 
1. CSS styling, while something I am beginning to understand, is still difficult to work with at times.
1. Aesthetic design. I am an artist, not a designer, so I had no idea how to make this look good.
